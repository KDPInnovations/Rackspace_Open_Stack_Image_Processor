This set of functions is designed to process an image file using iMagick by:

1. Copying that file from the web server to a temporary container.
2. Adding a message to iron.io message queue with the file name, name of the 
	container, new container name, image sizes to generate, and more.
3. Running a PHP function that pulls a message from the iron.io message queue.
4. If the new container name does not exist it creates the container, publishes
	it to the CDN, and creates a CNAME in Rackspace DNS for easy access.
5. Generating the various sizes of images and uploading them to the new container, 
	and optionally deleting the original image.
6. Adding a message to an iron.io message queue with the original file EXIF data 
	(which is stripped from the processed images), the original file name, and 
	your unique ID.




For more details on the operation of the files, see the comments in the PHP files.
